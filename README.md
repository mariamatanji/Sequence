# Sequence
The first and second integers in the input are read into variables previousData and currentData, respectively. Write a loop that iterates while currentData is 6 times previousData.

In each iteration:
Output currentData, followed by " is 6 times ", previousData, and ". Sequence is increasing geometrically." End with a newline.
Assign previousData with currentData.
Read the next integer from input and assign currentData with the integer read.
After the loop, output the last integer read followed by " breaks the sequence." and a newline.
